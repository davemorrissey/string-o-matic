## Contributing

Feature suggestions, pull requests, and bug reports are very welcome! Before starting, please take a look at the notes below.

### Reporting a bug

If you've found a bug, head over to the [issues page](https://github.com/string-o-matic/string-o-matic/issues). Before opening a new issue, search through open issues to see if someone else has already reported the same problem. Then open a new issue and complete the new issue template with as much information as you can - error messages, console logs and screenshots are particularly helpful. If you can try another browser that's also a great help. The more information you provide, the quicker the bug can be found and fixed!

### Requesting a feature

If you have an idea for a new feature, whether it's a new transformation step, a design tweak or an optimisation, first check the open issues and the projects pages to see whether it's already planned. If not, open a new issue and provide as much information as you can about how this feature should work, with worked examples and references if possible. The better you describe what you want, the more likely it is to be implemented!

### Asking a question

If you'd like to ask a question, please check [open and closed issues](https://github.com/string-o-matic/string-o-matic/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue) to see if your question already has an answer. If not, open a new issue and provide as much information as you can.

### Pull requests

If you'd like to contribute to this project, simply clone it and follow the instructions on the home page to get your development environment set up. Before starting a large or complex change, please raise an issue and describe what you're planning to do - this helps avoid duplicate effort, allows discussion about whether the feature is suitable, and provides a place to track the progress.

When coding, please bear the following guidelines in mind. Well tested and commented code that follows the current style is much more likely to be merged!

* Write unit tests for new code
* Run the existing unit tests and lint with `npm build` before committing
* Follow the style of existing code, even if you don't like it :-)
* Avoid refactoring existing code to your preferred style
* Avoid modifications to files unrelated to your change
* Comment your code if it's complicated
* Keep dependencies to a minimum
